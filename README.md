# Parcel Routing System

This code implements a Parcel Routing System (PRS) simulation. It simulates the movement of parcels and freight cars across different cities represented as vertices in a graph.
## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

3. Run the executable:

## Input Files

- `graph.txt`: Contains the connections between cities in the graph. Each line represents an edge between two cities.

- `bookings.txt`: Contains the details of parcels to be processed. Each line represents a parcel with its attributes separated by spaces.

## Output

The simulation generates various outputs, including:

- Status of all parcels at each time tick.
- Parcels delivered up to a specific time tick.
- Information about stranded parcels.

## Usage

To use the code:

1. Ensure you have the input files `graph.txt` and `bookings.txt` prepared.
2. Compile the code as described in the setup section.
3. Run the executable.
4. Review the output to understand the status and movement of parcels and freight cars.
